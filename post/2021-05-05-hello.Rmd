Hello! 
  In this blog post I will discuss how R Markdown can utilize more than one language in its code chunks. 
  You can type code in R like 
```{r}
#R Code Chunk 
numbers <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
mean(numbers)
```
  You can also type code in Python like 
```{python}
#Python Code Chunk
import statistics
from statistics import mean
numbers1 = [1,2,3,4,5]
mean(numbers1)
```
  Reticulate lets you interact R code with Python code!
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

hi<-"Hello"
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
hi="world"
print(r.hi,hi) 
```

```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(hi,py$hi))
```
